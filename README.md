This repository provides a working, lightning-fast, and highly accurate fingerprint driver for ElanTech sensors (specifically `04f3:0c4f`) on Linux. 

It completely bypasses the broken default `libfprint` image-matching algorithm. Instead, it turns the sensor into a "Match-on-Chip" style device by handling raw USB communication and using **OpenCV (SIFT)** for biometric authentication.

## 🛑 The Problem
The official Linux `libfprint` driver fails with this sensor because:
1. It assumes the sensor is a "dumb" image provider.
2. It tries to extract standard minutiae from a tiny 80x80 pixel matrix, which almost always fails (`score 0/24`, `verify-no-match`).

## 💡 The Solution
I hacked the driver architecture:
1. **Raw USB Capture:** I use `libusb` to send specific hex commands to wake up the sensor and grab the raw image buffer.
2. **SIFT Feature Extraction:** Instead of standard minutiae, I use OpenCV's Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT). It finds unique micro-patterns on your fingerprint, regardless of the angle.
3. **The "Super-Template":** During enrollment, the code waits for 5 separate touches and concatenates all unique keypoints into one massive reference template.
4. **Fast Verification:** When unlocking, it takes 1 quick frame and compares it against the Super-Template using a strict K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) matcher.

## 🕵️‍♂️ How I Reverse-Engineered the Protocol (Wireshark)
If you want to port this method to another unsupported sensor (e.g., Goodix, Egis), here is how I found the secret USB commands using **Wireshark** on Windows:

1. **Setup:** Install Wireshark with the **USBPcap** module on a Windows machine where the official driver works.
2. **Capture:** Start capturing the USB traffic for your specific USB Root Hub.
3. **Action:** Open Windows Hello, start enrolling a fingerprint, and touch the sensor a few times. Stop the capture.
4. **Analysis:** Filter the Wireshark packets by your device address (e.g., `usb.device_address == 5`).
5. **Finding the Commands:** Look at the packets sent *from* the host *to* the sensor just before I touched it. This is how I found the wake-up commands:
   * `0x40 0x31` (Wake up / Init)
   * `0x40 0x3f` and `0x00 0x09` (Request image data)
6. **Finding the Image Payload:** Look for the largest packets returning from the sensor. I found packets with exactly **12800 bytes** of leftover capture data.
   * *Math check:* `80 x 80 pixels = 6400 pixels`. Since the sensor uses 16-bit grayscale, `6400 * 2 bytes = 12800 bytes`. This confirmed I found the raw image!

## 🛠️ Installation Guide (Native C++ libfprint Driver)

**Requirements:** `libusb-1.0-0-dev`, `libopencv-dev`, `meson`, `ninja-build`

1. Clone the official `libfprint` v1.94 repository:
    git clone https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libfprint/libfprint.git
    cd libfprint
    git checkout v1.94.1

2. Copy the files from this repo's `native_libfprint_driver` folder into your `libfprint` source code:
   * Put `elan.c`, `sift_engine.cpp`, and `sift_engine.h` into `libfprint/drivers/`.
   * Replace `libfprint/meson.build` and the root `meson.build` with the modified ones provided here.

3. Build and install natively:
    meson setup builddir --wipe
    ninja -C builddir
    sudo ninja -C builddir install
    sudo ldconfig
    sudo systemctl restart fprintd

4. **Important:** Clear your old broken prints first!
    fprintd-delete "$USER"

5. Go to your KDE/GNOME system settings and enroll your fingerprint normally! (Touch the sensor 5 times during enrollment).

## 🐍 Python PAM Script (Bonus)
Check out the `python_pam_script/` folder for the initial prototype. It uses Python to do the exact same thing and hooks into the Linux PAM system. It's a great educational tool for reading and understanding the raw logic without compiling C++ code.
